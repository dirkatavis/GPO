"""Post-submit outcome detection for the Compass GO Scan view.

After submitting an MVA, the app can settle on one of several outcomes:
- Vehicle Details heading (the happy path)
- "Vehicle Not Found" error card
- (future) other terminal states

`ScanPage.submit` polls these detectors in order until one fires or the
outcome timeout elapses. Each detector is a small callable bound to the
Playwright Page that returns an `Outcome` enum value (or None if it can't
yet make a determination).

To add a new detector:
    1. Define a function `def detect_<name>(page) -> Outcome | None`.
    2. Append it to `DEFAULT_DETECTORS` below in the desired priority order.
    3. If the new outcome should bubble up as its own exception, extend
       `ScanPage.submit` to map it accordingly.
